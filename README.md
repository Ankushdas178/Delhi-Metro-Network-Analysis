# Delhi-Metro-Network-Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the Delhi Metro network to achieve various objectives such as optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, and understanding travel patterns. By employing machine learning and data science techniques, we aim to derive insights that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Delhi Metro system.

Below is the process we can follow for the task of Metro Network Analysis of Delhi:

- Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.
- Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.
- Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
- Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.
- Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.
